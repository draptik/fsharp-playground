# SAFE Dojo

This self-study repository is designed to allow you to experience the SAFE stack based on an ready-made application that you can build on top of. It will take around 90 minutes for you to complete if you have no experience in any of these technologies.

Please read the [instructions.md](Instructions.md) for a guide on completing this dojo to learn all about the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/) and F#.

## Prerequisites

* [.NET Core SDK 2.x](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/) installed
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager
* [Node 8.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components
* [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/) if you're running on Linux or OSX
* An F# code editor such as:
   * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Ionide](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) extension
   * [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
   * [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

## Building
`build.cmd run` or `build.sh run`.

If using Visual Studio 2017, do NOT attempt to build directly in VS. You *must* use `build.cmd` to compile and run the application.
